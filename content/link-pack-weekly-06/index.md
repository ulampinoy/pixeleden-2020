> For decades, she supported herself as a nanny in the wealthy enclaves of the city. But her real work was roaming the streets with her camera (often with her young charges in tow), capturing images of sublime spontaneity, wit, and compositional savvy. When pressed about her occupation by a man she once knew, Maier didn‚Äôt describe herself as a nanny. *She said, ‚ÄúI am sort of a spy.‚Äù All the best street photographers are.*
